# x64 Assembly Language Examples (Unix/Linux)

The following examples were created while working through the book *Beginning
x64 Assembly Programming: From Novice to AVX Professional* by Jo Van Hoey. Most
of the examples were modified from the original, or were only inspired by those
in the book. Others may be unrelated to the book as I tried out other things in
order to understand concepts.

Original example code is here: https://github.com/Apress/beginning-x64-assembly-programming.
